# Discrete Analysis

## Laboratory works on Discrete Analysis 2 course

All directories includes `main.cpp` or `main.c` file with program *realisation* of personal exercise, 
file with *task description* and `report.pdf` file with *description of solution and work*. 

Also `report.pdf` include *compile instruction* and *run demonstration*.

Some directories includes test file or test generator for *work demonstration*.

Work №2 and №4 doesn't compiles with pedantic keys because some defines not in standart. But it workes good and old checker aceppted this.
